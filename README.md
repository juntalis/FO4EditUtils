## FO4Edit Utilities
Stuff to help out when using [TES5Edit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) to mod Fallout 4.

* [TES5EditStub](TES5EditStub/) - Makes it possible to launch TES5Edit in Fallout 4 mode from the [Nexus Mod Manager](http://www.nexusmods.com/games/mods/modmanager/).
* [EditScripts](EditScripts/)   - Contains a few Pascal scripts I wrote to automate some of the tedious tasks I find myself doing a lot. See the [list](EditScripts/README.md).
